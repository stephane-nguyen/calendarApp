# Project Architecture

> We used MVC pattern to organize the source code. A few Unit Tests were written for Front and Back-End.

## Front-end Architecture

> It contains the View of the project. <br>
> We keep it simple since the front for the project is not that big. So JavaScript pages are ranked simply by their theme.

## Back-end Architecture

> It contains the Model and Controller. <br>

## Database Architecture

> We used phpMyAdmin to manage the database. <br> > ![img](/images/db_architecture.png)
